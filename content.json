You can only modify the Markdown in Marxico to do that. Next version will fix this. Dancing with EvernoteNotebook &amp; TagsMarxico add @(Notebook)[tag1|tag2|tag3] syntax to select notebook and set tags for the note. After typing @(, the notebook list would appear, please select one from it. TitleMarxico would adopt the first heading encountered as the note title. For example, in this manual the first line Welcome to Marxico is the title. Quick EditingNote saved by Marxico in Evernote would have a red ribbon button on the top-right corner. Click it and it would bring you back to Marxico to edit the note. Note: Currently Marxico is unable to detect and merge any modifications in Evernote by user. Please go back to Marxico to edit. Data SynchronizationWhile saving rich HTML content in Evernote, Marxico puts the Markdown text in a hidden area of the note, which makes it possible to get the original text in Marxico and edit it again. This is a really brilliant design because: it is beyond just one-way exporting HTML which other services do; and it avoids privacy and security problems caused by storing content in a intermediate server. Privacy Statement: All of your notes data are saved in Evernote. Marxico doesn’t save any of them. Offline StorageMarxico stores your unsynchronized content locally in browser storage, so no worries about network and broswer crash. It also keeps the recent file list you’ve edited in Document Management(Ctrl + O). Note: Although browser storage is reliable in the most time, Evernote is born to do that. So please sync the document regularly while writing.
